# Mobile Network Operator Subscription Management Software
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a subscription management software for Matsecom, a mobile network operator that provides voice and data services over GSM, UMTS, 
and LTE systems. The software will be responsible for managing postpaid client subscriptions, user identifications, mobile phone types, and the class of user
subscription per user. It will also monitor and store data for user sessions to generate appropriate invoices later on. 
The software should include various reporting functions to display relevant data for subscribers, sessions, and invoices.

## Request for Information
Request for Information (RFI)

Matsecom invites all companies with proven experience in application development for IP-based telecommunications services to respond to this RFI. 
The participating companies are expected to submit information documents that address the issues and objectives of the considered service or application. 

## Features
Our solution is able to provide the following features:

    1. Subscriber Management: The software manages subscribers, including the types of mobile terminals used and the class of subscriptions.

    2. Charging System: For voice calls and mobile data sessions, the system determines the quantity of data or voice charges and add them to the user account. Data sessions may be rejected when a subscriber has used up all data volume in their tariff.

    3. Invoice Generation: The solution provides complete details for a relevant invoice, summarizing the voice calls and data charges of the last invoicing period.
## Technology Stack
This project is implemend with pure Java, the JEE platform for backend code and an intuitive UI implemented with simple Java code.
